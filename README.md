# Rust Unit Testing
I created this small program to demonstrate testing in the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 

Read my blog post for context. Click [here](https://www.masaimahapa.co.za/posts/30-days-of-rust-day-11).

For this I created a fair die, which the user can choose the number of sides they want it to have.

## How to run
You firstly need to have [rust Installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then after cloning this repository, run the following command inside the root.

```
cargo test
```
